I am Nguyễn Đức Dũng, a front-end developer (ReactJS) with nearly 4 years of experience. This is my submission for the code challenge for the Front-End Developer (ReactJS) position at 99Tech.

I have completed Problem 1, Problem 2, and Problem 3. For Problems 1 and 3, I provided my solutions in a single file for each. For Problem 2, I used ReactJS built with Vite.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any feedback or evaluations regarding my submission.

Let me know if you need further modifications!
